## Data collection
- “The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017”, Accessed from https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017 on 08/04/2020
- Anonymized dataset contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users.

## Research study
**1. Exploratory analysis on customer shopping behavior on the Instacart platform:**
- When do customers buy groceries online?
- Does the hour of the day and/or the day of the week affect the order volume?
- When do consumers order again? How many days it take to make another order?
- How many items do people buy?
- Which products are sold most often? And which ones are reorder the most?
- How often do people order the same items again?
      
**2. Customer segmentation**
      Clustering analysing based on consumers orders

**3. Prediction model: Which sets of products are frequently bought together?**
- Build the model using the mlxtend library:
- Apriori function to extract frequent itemsets for association rule mining
      - Association rule function to generate association rules from frequent itemsets
